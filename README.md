# 2025-MLB-Replay-Simulator
The MLB Replay Simulator is a terminal-based Python application that tries to simulate realistic baseball games using 2025 season real player data. Unlike simple random number generators, this simulation uses a Sabermetric Engine that calculates outcomes based on real baseball statistics (OBP, WHIP, ERA, OPS, and Defensive Data).
